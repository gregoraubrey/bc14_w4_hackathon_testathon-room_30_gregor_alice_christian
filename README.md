  Test-athon 🧪

We've delved into testing over the past few days, so it's time to keep practicing.

Tips for more testable code:

- For unit tests, you'll want your functions to do one thing. These functions should ideally be: small, predictable (i.e. for the same input/arguments, they return the same output), without side effects (i.e. they don't change or interact with something outside of themselves).
- For integration tests, what you're testing can be more complicated, as individual software units are combined and tested as a group.
- For more best practices when writing testable code, read [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/javascript-testing-best-practices/).
- The guide in this [Github repo](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices) contains testing wisdom and good practices! Have a look at the first few examples in the beginning sections to reinforce what we learned in class (and feel free to peruse the rest if you'd like).

## End-to-end testing

Take some time to familiarise yourself with how the app works. For this part, it's important that you run the app in the browser and understand/experience it from a user's perspective (as opposed to only looking at the code). You can run the app by installing dependencies with `npm i` and then running `npm start`. The `start` script runs/serves the web page locally on your machine, so make sure it's still running when you run your test. (You can check if the web page is working by visiting the URL in a browser.)

Set up and install Playwright using the documentation (https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). Then write an end-to-end test which checks the user journey/flow below:

> A user visits the site, adds a new todo to the list, deletes a todo from the list, refreshes the page and the todos are still persisted/saved.

For each step, think about how you can simulate any user interactions and which assertions would be useful to make and would give confidence.

Feel free to change the existing HTML or the JS to make it easier for you to get/select elements from your tests. If you're using `getByRole`, feel free to use a resource like https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance to understand which role needs to be specified.

## Refactor and extend

Now that you've got some tests in place to cover existing functionality, feel free to refactor the code or iteratively add new features (e.g. styling, ability to update todos, more information for each todo, having a todo list per user instead of just one todo list, etc.).

If you refactor (maybe you've spotted something that can be simplified or made more readable), you can then rerun your tests after refactoring to check that nothing has unexpectedly broken or changed.

For each feature that you add, make sure you plan it out (as always) and add more tests to verify it's working correctly.
